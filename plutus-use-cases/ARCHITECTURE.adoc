=== `plutus-use-cases`

This package contains worked examples of a number of contracts, along with
tests using the emulator. This should always be our "most real" project: this is
where we try and do the things that we think people will really try and do.

It has a few other miscellaneous tests and benchmarks that use the use-cases as
a source of large/real validators.
