Building blocks
===============

The `Marconi Github repository <https://github.com/input-output-hk/marconi>`_ contains a set of Haskell packages which satisfy two main use cases:

* building your own chain-indexer in Haskell
* reusing predefined indexers

In this section of the documentation, we will describe these different packages as well the main building blocks for defining Marconi indexers.
