[#10-PlutusTx]
= Plutus Tx

.. formal specification of the typed Plutus Core language

Plutus Tx is the name that we give to specially-delimited sections of a Haskell
program which will be compiled into Plutus Core (that usually go in a transaction,
hence the "Tx").

This means that Plutus Tx is just Haskell. Strictly speaking, only a subset of Haskell is
supported, but the majority of simple Haskell should work, and the compiler will tell you if
you use something that is unsupported.

The key technique that the Plutus Platform uses is called staged metaprogramming.
What that means is that the main Haskell program generates another program, in
this case the Plutus Core program that will run on the blockchain. Plutus Tx is
the mechanism that we use to write those programs. The fact that it is just
Haskell means that we can use the same techniques that we use in the main program,
and we can share types and definitions between the two.
