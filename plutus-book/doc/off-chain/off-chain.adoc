= Writing off-chain code

Working with Plutus requires writing on-chain code and off-chain
code with both parts working well together.

Instead of diving right in,
let us start simple with an example that has no on-chain
code at all and exclusively uses off-chain code running in the wallet!

Let us reimplement the `payToWallet_` function from the
Playground, which allows transferring Ada from one
wallet to another without involving any smart contracts!
