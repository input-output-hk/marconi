=== `plutus-tx`

This package provides several things:

- The Plutus Tx compiler, which compiles GHC Core into
Plutus IR.
- A GHC Core plugin, which is the mechanism by which people use
the compiler.
- A couple of special typeclasses which aid with the interface
between Haskell and Plutus Tx, and Template Haskell support for
generating instances.
- It provides a partial replacement Prelude, since many parts of the
normal Haskell Prelude cannot be used with Plutus Tx.
