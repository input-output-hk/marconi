- [ ] Internal library?
- [ ] Fix up constructor for `LamAbs`.
- [ ] Use another type parameter for `Name` vs. `Term`, i.e. annotate a `Name`
  with its binding, i.e. its type in a lambda abstraction.
- [ ] For `Term` post-renaming, use a `tyname` of `(Kind, a)` or something: see
  slack!
- [ ] Monad would have to keep a map of (Name, nameWithType)
