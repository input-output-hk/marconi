 This module propose an alternative to the index implementation proposed in 'RewindableIndex.Storable'.

 The point we wanted to address are the folowing:

    * @Storable@ implementation is designed in a way that strongly promotes indexers
      that rely on a mix of database and in-memory storage.
      We try to propose a more generic design that would allow:

        * full in-memory indexers
        * indexer backed by a simple file
        * indexer transformers, that add capability (logging, caching...) to an indexer
        * mock indexer, for testing purpose, with predefined behaviour
        * group of indexers, synchronised as a single indexer
        * implement in-memory/database storage that rely on other query heuristic

    * The original implementation considered the @StorablePoint@ as data that can be derived from @Event@,
      leading to the design of synthetic events to deal with indexer that didn't index enough data.

    * In marconi, the original design uses a callback design to handle `MVar` modification,
      we wanted to address this point as well.

What's included in this module:

    * Base type classes to define an indexer, its query interface, and the required plumbing to handle rollback.
    * A full in-memory indexer (naive), a full SQLite indexer
      and an indexer that compose it with a SQL layer for persistence.
    * A coordinator for indexers, that can be exposed as an itdexer itself.
    * Some queries that can be applied to many indexers.
    * Several modifiers for indexers:
        * Tracing, as a modifier to an existing indexer.
          (it allows us to opt-in for traces if we want, indexer by indexer)
        * Delay to delay event processing for heavy computation.
        * Pruning, to compact data that can't be rollbacked.

  Contrary to the original Marconi design, indexers don't have a unique (in-memory/sqlite) implementation.

  (non-exhaustive) TODO list:

    * Provide a less naive in-memory indexer implementation than the list one
    * Test, test, test. The current code is not tested, and it's wrong.
      Ideally, we should be able to provide a model-based testing approach to specify
      what we expect from indexers.
    * Re-implement some of our indexers.
    * Split up this mess in modules.
    * Generate haddock, double-check it, fill the void.
    * Provide a tutorial on how to write indexer, transformers, and how to instantiate them.
    * Cold start from disk.
    * Provide MonadState version of the functions that manipulates the indexer.

Howto:

    * Setup an existing indexer

        1. You need to define a type for @event@ (the input of your indexer).
        As soon as it's done, define the 'Point' type instance for this event,
        'Point' is a way to know when the Point was emitted.
        It can be a time, a slot number, whatever information that tracks when
        an event happen.

        2. Choose the based indexing instances that you need to index your events.

            The most common approach is to go for a 'MixedIndexer'
            with an in memory indexer and a disk indexer.
            At the moment, 'ListIndexer' is the only pre-existing in memory indexer
            and 'SQLiteIndexer' is the only pre-existing on disk indexer.

            If you want to go with it, it's probably better to follow the steps below
            with the `ListIndexer` first, then with the `SQLiteIndexer`
            and finally with the `MixedIndexer`.

        3. You then need to implement the 'IsIndex' and 'IsSync'
           typeclasses for your indexer.

            If you went for a 'MixedIndexer' with a 'ListIndexer' and a 'SQLiteIndexer',
            these instances are already defined.

        4. You can then continue with 'Rewindable' instances for your indexer
           that handles the rollbacks.

            With the default 'MixedIndexer'/'ListIndexer'/'SQLiteIndexer' mix,
            you only need to define the instance for 'SQLiteIndexer'.
            'rewindSQLiteIndexerWith' can help to avoid boilerplate.

        5. The next step is probably to define a query type for your indexer.
        A query type usually come with a 'Result' type instance,
        the expected answer for this query.

        6. Then, for this query you need to define the 'Queryable' instances that
        correspond to your indexer.

            If you use a 'MixedIndexer' you need to define 'Queryable'
            only for the on-disk storage (@store@) and 'ResumableResult'
            for the in-memory part (@mem@).

        7. You have the minimal needed to run your indexer.

    * Writing a new indexer: The steps are almost the same as those for reusing an
    indexer, except that you have to think about how it should be done in the general
    case.

        Best practices is to implement as much as we can 'event'/'query' agnostic
        instances of the typeclasses of these module for the new indexer.
        When it's impossible to write a typeclass, think about how we can reduce the
        boilerplate with a helper function, and expose it.

        Try to provide a smart constructor to hide most of the complexity of your indexer.
