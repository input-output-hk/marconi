This file documents bugs/fixes made after publication:

26 November 2019:

The rule β-wrap should insist that the body is a value. Otherwise
it is possible to apply either the ξ-wrap or the β-wrap rule to the
same term. 

3 March 2020:

The rule β-Λ should insist the body of the Λ is a value. Otherwise it
is possible to apply either ξ-Λ inside ξ-·⋆ or β-Λ to the same term.

Added proofs of progress disjointness and determinism of the reduction
rules to the source of the paper (not shown in the paper).
