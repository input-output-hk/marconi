== Introduction

Marconi is a lightweight customizable solution for indexing and querying the Cardano blockchain.

[[Architecture]]
== Architecture

Marconi consists of a set of compomentes:

- link:./marconi-core[marconi-core]
- link:./marconi-chain-index[marconi-chain-indexer]
- link:./marconi-sidechain[marconi-sidechain]

== Development

[[how-to-develop]]
=== How to develop and contribute to the project

Run `nix develop` to enter the development shell and you will be presented with a list of available commands.

**Please see link:CONTRIBUTING{outfilesuffix}[CONTRIBUTING] for comprehensive documentation on how to contribute to the project, including development and submitting changes*

== Documentation

=== User documentation

User documentations are work in progress. You may generate Haskell API documenations (haddocks) directly from the `nix shell` for each of marconi compoments:

```
cabal haddock marconi-core
cabal haddock marconi-chain-index
cabal haddock marconi-sidechain

```

=== Dependency update

The dependency update policy is dependent on the protected branch.

For `cardano-node`, we define major-version-bound the range of versions which are compatible with a specific era.
For example, for the Alonzo era, that would be `>= 1.29 && < 1.35`. For the Vasil era, that would be `>= 1.35 && < 1.36`.

Independently of the protected branch:

* It should always use the same first-major-version of `plutus` as the one used by the `plutus` dependency of `cardano-node`
* It should always be safe to upgrade to a new second-major-version of `plutus`: at worst this will lead to some code breakage.
* It should, unless specified otherwise, use the same version for transitive dependencies (`cardano-ledger`, `ouroboros-network`, etc.) with `cardano-node`
* It should pin the major version of `cardano-node` for all packages
* It should pin the first and second-major version of `plutus` for all packages

`main` branch:

* It should not update `cardano-node` to a new major-version. In other words, it should use a `cardano-node` version which is compatible with the current Cardano mainnet
* It should use a `cardano-wallet` version which is compatible with the current `cardano-node` version

== Working with the project

=== How to submit an issue

Issues can be filed in the https://github.com/input-output-hk/marconi/issues[GitHub Issue tracker].

However, note that this is pre-release software, so we will not usually be providing support.
